# *Association Rule Mining in Course Catalog Data*


## Description

## Data found inside CSV file 

### This Python script performs association rule mining on a course catalog dataset to uncover frequent itemsets and generate association rules. Using the mlxtend library, it calculates the relative frequency of items (courses), identifies frequent itemsets with a minimum support threshold, and generates association rules based on the confidence metric. The rules are then sorted by lift and the top 10 rules are displayed, along with interpretations of the results. This analysis helps identify patterns of course purchases, which could be used for personalized recommendations or curriculum planning.
